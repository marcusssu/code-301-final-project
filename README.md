  SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, provides millions of low­income individuals with economic assistance
across the country. Affording to keep food on the table all month isn't always easy. A lot of us just don't make enough money,
whether it's that we can't get the hours we need, the areas we live are becoming unaffordable, or we just don't quite have that
dream job yet doesn't matter. What matters is that we have access to these opportunities and resources that can help guide us to
good decisions.

  While there are resources out there to help people with SNAP, they are often clunky and scattered. We aim to provide a
functional, user­friendly, and modern service so that users can find retailers, compare pricing, and learn about nutrition
and shopping strategies.
